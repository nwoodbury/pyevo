        Updates a single round of the game.

        The phases of the round are as follows:
            1. Each agent first plays against all of its neighbors. Payoffs are
               calculated as the average of payoffs against all neighbors
               played (thus border agents are roughly equal to inner agents).
            2. Update agent states.
            3. Each agent evaluates its own average payoff with that of the
               others. Determines which strategy to switch to (doesn't
               switch yet, lets all others make the same evaluation).
            4. Each agent switches to the new agent
